# Competitive Programming Solutions

This is a collection of programming solutions from different online judges, where most of the problems are solved using C++, while some are also using Java and Python.

I have been solving competitive programming problems since the beginning of my undergraduate studies in Computer Science in 2011 at Pontificia Universidad CatÃ³lica Madre y Maestra (PUCMM), Santiago de los Caballeros, Dominican Republic.
